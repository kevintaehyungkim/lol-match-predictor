Stanford STATS 202 Final Project: LoL Match Prediction

League of Legends (LoL) is a team-oriented strategy game developed by Riot Games in 2009 that evolved from a small North American community to an international gaming powerhouse that now boasts over 115 million monthly players worldwide. To put this number into perspective, the next most popular game is Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) which has 26 million monthly users, followed by Dota 2 at 11 million and Minecraft at 10 million. 

The goal of this project is to utilize regression and classifying techniques combined with my understanding of the game to construct a model that best understands the win conditions and strategies in the current meta. I will then assess the modelâ€™s consistency in correctly selecting the winning team of any single high-elo ranked game of League of Legends given numbers that represent the game state.
